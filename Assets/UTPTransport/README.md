# UTPTransport for Mirror

This sample contains a [Transport](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/transports) for the [Mirror Networking library](https://mirror-networking.com/) that is compatible with the [Unity Transport package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@latest) and the [Unity Relay service](https://docs.unity.com/relay).

## Dependencies

- [Mirror Networking library](https://mirror-networking.com/)
- [Unity Jobs package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.jobs@latest)
- [Unity Relay package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.services.relay@latest)

## Installation

1. Visit the [Mirror page in the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321) and add Mirror to `My Assets`.
2. Import Mirror using the Package Manager (`Window -> Package Manager -> Packages: My Assets -> Mirror -> Download/Import`).
3. Import Unity Jobs using the Package Manager (`Window -> Package Manager -> Add -> Add package from git URL... -> "com.unity.jobs"`).
3. Import Unity Relay using the Package Manager (`Window -> Package Manager -> Add -> Add package from git URL... -> "com.unity.services.relay"`).
4. Copy the `Assets\UTPTransport` directory from this sample into the `Assets/` directory in your project.
5. Attach the `Mirror.NetworkManager` component to your `GameObject`.
6. Attach the `UTP.UtpTransport` component to your `GameObject`.
7. Assign the `UTP.UtpTransport` component to the `Transport` field of the `Mirror.NetworkManager` component.

## Utilizing Relay

If you want to use Relay, you must use `UTP.RelayNetworkManager` instead of `Mirror.NetworkManager`.

`UTP.RelayNetworkManager` inherits from `Mirror.NetworkManager` and adds additional functionality to interact with the Relay service.

_Note:_ 
In order to use Relay, you must authenticate with the [Unity Authentication Service](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/IntroUnityAuthentication.htm). 
This is required regardless of whether or not you are utilizing your own authentication service.

The following snippet demonstrates how to authenticate with the Unity Authentication Service:
```csharp
try
{
    await UnityServices.InitializeAsync();
    await AuthenticationService.Instance.SignInAnonymouslyAsync();
    Debug.Log("Logged into Unity, player ID: " + AuthenticationService.Instance.PlayerId);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Debug.LogError(e);
}
```

Once authenticated, you may use `UTP.RelayNetworkManager` to either allocate a Relay server or join a Relay server using a join code.
