# UTP Transport for Mirror

This is the [Unity Transport Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@1.0/manual/index.html) (UTP) transport for [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror). It is actively in development and is not considered stable.

## Dependencies

- Mirror ([Documentation](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/))
- UTP ([Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@1.0/manual/index.html))

## Installation

1. Visit the [Mirror Asset Store Page](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321) and add Mirror to "My Assets"
2. Import Mirror with Package Manager (Window -> Package Manager -> Packages: My Assets -> Mirror -> Download/Import)
3. Import UTP with Package Manager (Window -> Package Manager -> Add -> Add package from git URL... -> "com.unity.transport@1.0.0-pre.10")
4. Copy the directory that this README is in to your "Assets" folder
5. Attach a "NetworkManager" found within the Mirror assests to a "GameObject" in your "Scene".
6. Attach a "UtpTransport" component to the same "GameObject" as your "NetworkManager"
7. Select the "UtpTransport" as the transport for your "NetworkManager"

## Utilizing Relay

If you would like to utilize Relay, instead of attaching Mirrors "NetworkManager" to a "GameObject" in your "Scene", you will want to attach a "RelayNetworkManager". The "RelayNetworkManager" class inherits from Mirrors "NetworkManager", adding some additional functionality that enables an easy way to interact with the Relay service.

From there, you must authenticate witih [Unity Authentication Service](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/IntroUnityAuthentication.htm). _Note:_ This is a requirement even if you are using your own authentication service as well. The simplest implementation for this is the following:

```
try
{
    await UnityServices.InitializeAsync();
    await AuthenticationService.Instance.SignInAnonymouslyAsync();
    Debug.Log("Logged into Unity, player ID: " + AuthenticationService.Instance.PlayerId);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Debug.Log(e);
}
```

You may now call the public functions in the "RelayNetworkManager" to either allocate a Relay server or join one via a join code.
