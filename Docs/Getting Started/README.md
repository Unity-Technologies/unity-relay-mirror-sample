# Unity Mirror Relay Mirror Adapter
The Unity Mirror Sample project demonstrates how to use the Unity Transport Package (UTP), the Unity Relay service, and the Mirror Networking API together. You can access the sample project directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/unity-technologies/unity-relay-mirror-sample).

* The Unity Transport Package (UTP) is a low-level networking library that provides a connection-based abstraction layer over UDP sockets with optional functionality such as reliability, ordering, and fragmentation.
* Relay is a Unity service that facilitates securely connecting players by using a join code style workflow without the need for dedicated game servers or peer-to-peer communication.
* The Mirror Networking API is a high-level networking library for the Unity Platform.

**Note:** The Unity Mirror Sample project uses code and information from [Shrine's Mirror Networking series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShrineApp).
# Requirements
The Unity Mirror sample has the following requirements:
* Unity services
	* Unity Transport Package (UTP)
	* Unity Relay Service
	* [Unity Authentication Service](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/IntroUnityAuthentication.htm) (UAS)
* Mirror Networking API
* [Unity Editor version 2020.3.24f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.24) (for the [game client](#game-client) and [game server](#game-server))
# Components
The Unity Mirror Sample project has three distinct components:
* [Game client](#game-client)
* [Game server](#game-server)

The game client and game server components use Unity and the Mirror Networking API. 
# Game client
The game client is the executable players run locally on their machine to connect to the game server and backend services.

**Note:** You must use Unity Editor version [2020.3.24f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.24) for the game client and game server.
# Game server
The game server is the build executable that runs the game server process. 

You can run the game server executable locally (for development) or host it with a service such as Multiplay for production.

**Note:** You must use Unity Editor version [2020.3.24f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.24) for the game client and game server.

# Work with and extend the sample project
The Unity Mirror Sample project provides sample code for performing the following tasks:
1. [Initialize the Mirror Network Manager](#initialize-the-mirror-network-manager)
1. [Add Relay functionality](#add-relay-functionality)
1. [Add UTP Transport functionality](#add-utp-functionality)
1. [Tie everything together with a custom Network Manager](#create-a-custom-network-manager)
1. [Expose a GUI for testing](#expose-a-user-interface)
## Initialize the Mirror Network Manager
The *NetworkManager* class in *Assets/Mirror/Runtime/NetworkManager.cs* is a singleton instance of the Mirror Network Manager. Use the Mirror Network Manager component to manage the networking aspects of multiplayer games, such as game state management, spawn management, and scene management.
## Add Relay functionality
The *RelayNetworkManager* class in *Assets/UTPTransport/RelayNetworkManager.cs* extends the *NetworkManager* class with Relay capabilities. It demonstrates how to:
* Use [join codes](https://docs.unity.com/relay/join-codes.html).
* Get [Relay server](https://docs.unity.com/relay/relay-servers.html) information.
* Check for available [Relay regions](https://docs.unity.com/relay/locations-and-regions.html).
* [Start the NetworkDriver as a host player](https://docs.unity.com/relay/relay-and-utp.html#starting-the-networkdriver-as-a-host-player).
* Join Relay servers.
* Connect using a join code.
## Add UTP functionality
The *UtpTransport* class in *Assets/UTPTransport/UtpTransport.cs* is an instance of *Mirror.Transport* that is compatible with UTP and Relay. It demonstrates how to:
* Configure the client with a Relay join code
* Get an [allocation](https://docs.unity.com/relay/allocations-service.html) from a join code
* Get Relay region
* Allocate a Relay server
## Create a custom Network Manager
The *MyNetworkManager* class in *Assets/Scripts/MyNetworkManager.cs* is an instance of *RelayNetworkManager* that ties the functionality of the UTP transport for Mirror and the Relay service together.
## Expose a user interface
The *MenuUI* class in *Assets/Scripts/MenuUI.cs* is responsible for displaying the UI that drives the sample. It interfaces with *MyNetworkManager* to launch servers and connect clients.
# Test the sample project
To launch two instances of the sample project for testing purposes, complete the following steps:
1. Open the sample project in the Unity Editor. The project supports Unity 2019.4.11f1 or later.
1. Select **ParallelSync > Clones Manager** from the editor dropdown. ParallelSync allows you to launch multiple editor instances of the same project.
1. Select **Add new clone**.
	* **NOTE**: This operation can fail on Windows if the maximum path length (260 characters) is exceeded.
1. After you have created the clone, select **Open in New Editor**.
1. Select **Play** in both editor instances.
1. Select **Auth Login** on both editor instances. This authenticates with the Unity Authentication Service (UAS) for Relay.

After you have authenticated booth editor instances with UAS for Relay, you can test the UTP transport and Relay functionality of the sample project.

Use the sample GUI to test the following functionality:
1. Select **Standard Host** to launch a server using the UTP transport. 
1. Select **Client (DGS)** to connect to a server using the UTP transport.
1. Select **Relay Host** to launch a Relay server.
1. Select **Client (Relay)** to connect to a Relay server.

**Note:** Ensure that you are using the correct buttons when testing each component
# Use UTP Transport for Mirror in your project
This sample contains a [Unity Transport Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@1.0/manual/index.html) (UTP) transport for [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror). You can use the code from this sample in your own project by following the instructions in the [Install the sample section](#install-the-sample-project).

**Note:** The sample project code has the following dependencies:

* Mirror ([Documentation](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/))
* UTP ([Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@1.0/manual/index.html))
* Relay ([Documentation](https://docs.unity.com/relay/introduction.html))
## Install the sample project
Complete the following steps to install the UTP Transport implementation from the sample project into your project.
1. Go to the [Mirror page in the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321).
1. Select **Add Mirror to My Assets**.
1. Launch the Unity Editor.
	1. Import Mirror by using the Package Manager: select **Window > Package Manager > Packages: My Assets > Mirror > Download/Import**.
	1. Import UTP by using the Package Manager: select **Window > Package Manager > Add > Add package from git URL... > "com.unity.transport@1.0.0"**.
	1. Copy the *Assets\UTPTransport* directory from the sample project into your project.
	1. Attach the *Mirror.NetworkManager* component to your *GameObject*.
	1. Attach the *UTP.UtpTransport* component to your *GameObject*.
	1. Assign the *UTP.UtpTransport* component to the *Transport* field of the *Mirror.NetworkManager* component.
## Use Relay with UTP
If you want to use Relay, you must use *UTP.RelayNetworkManager* instead of *Mirror.NetworkManager.* This is because *UTP.RelayNetworkManager* inherits from *Mirror.NetworkManager* and adds functionality for interacting with the Relay service.

Before you use Relay, you must authenticate with the [Unity Authentication Service](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/IntroUnityAuthentication.htm) (UAS). The Relay service requires that you authenticate even if you are using your own authentication service.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to authenticate with the Unity Authentication Service:
```csharp
try
{
   await UnityServices.InitializeAsync();
   await AuthenticationService.Instance.SignInAnonymouslyAsync();
   Debug.Log("Logged into Unity, player ID: " + AuthenticationService.Instance.PlayerId);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
   Debug.LogError(e);
}
```

After you are authenticated, you can use *UTP.RelayNetworkManager* to allocate a Relay server or join a Relay server by using a join code.
# Cross-compile for Linux
You can cross-compile both the game client and game server executables for Linux through the Unity Editor:
1. Launch the Unity Hub, then select **Installs**.
1. Select the gear next to version 2020.3.24f1.
1. Select **Add modules**.
1. Select the **Linux Build Support (IL2CPP & Mono)** module, then select **Install**.

After the Linux Build Support module finishes installing, select Linux as a build option within the Unity Editor:
1. Launch the Unity Editor.
1. Select **File > Build Settings...**
1. Select **Linux** as the Target Platform.
1. Select **Server build** to package a server build. Otherwise, select **Build** and choose a build location.
# Run the game client
You can run the game client component locally as a standalone application or through the Unity Editor.

To run the game client as a standalone application:
1. Select the game client executable through the file explorer or through a command-line interface.

To run the game client through the Unity Editor:
1. Open the Unity Mirror Sample project with the Unity Editor (version 2020.3.24f1).
1. Select Play to run the game within the Unity Editor.

**Note:** It might take a couple of minutes for Unity to import all the files and packages when you first open the Unity Mirror Sample project.
# Run the game server
You can run the game server component locally through a command-line interface with the `-server` argument.
# Run the game client and game server together
You can run both the [game client](#run-the-game-client) and [the game server](#run-the-game-server) executables locally by running one as a standalone application and the other through the Unity Editor.

**Note:** Before you can run the game client and game server, you must create both a server build and a client build. To create target builds for Linux, see [Cross-compile for Linux](#cross-compile-for-linux).

For example, to run the game server as a standalone application and the game client through the Unity Editor:
1. Start the game server through the command-line interface. Append the -log argument to view logs in real-time. 
1. In the Unity Editor, select **Start Client**.

**Note:** The default port for the game server is 7777.
