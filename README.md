# Unity Relay Mirror Sample
The Unity Relay Mirror Sample demonstrates how to use the [Unity Transport Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@latest), the [Unity Relay service](https://docs.unity.com/relay), and the [Mirror Networking library](https://mirror-networking.com/) together. 

* The Unity Transport Package is a low-level networking library that provides a connection-based abstraction layer over UDP sockets with optional functionality such as reliability, ordering, and fragmentation.
* Relay is a Unity service that facilitates securely connecting players by using a join code style workflow without the need for dedicated game servers or peer-to-peer communication.
* The Mirror Networking library is a high-level networking library for the Unity Platform.

The [Unity Relay](https://docs.unity.com/relay) documentation contains additional information on the usage of this sample.
